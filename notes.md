# Be Friends With Your Designers And Style Guides

--

### Abstract

When you are a developer you sometimes struggle to understand what designers are asking you for. As a designer you ask yourself why developers cannot just do what you expect.
To deliver good work it is important to understand each other. On this foundation a lot of problems can be avoided in advance.
Enter the world of style guides and see how they can improve this cooperation.

	- to work faster together

* Game
	* All stand up
	* Who does only design
	* Who does only code
	* Who does neither?
	* Everyone else knows how they have to fight their inner dev or designer to accept the opinion of the other "soul"

- When working in a team…
	- Because we are all different and we prefere different style it's important to create guidelines together
	- Together… because it is hard to change your own opinion
	- How to change behavior
		- Biological reasons and logical thinking.
		- Choice and models of agency.
		- Social belonging.
		- Goals and feedback.
- What are Style Guides for developers?
	- Coding Guidelines / Coding style

	* Game
		* Who builds Websites?
		* Who builds Webapps?
		* Who works on their companies own project?
		* Conclusion: For websites is sometimes hard to develop style guides because of budgeting reasons
			* Large scale web-apps and projects demand a style guide in order to keep everyone in the team on board

	- Examples
		- DGU
	- Building separate components
		- We know this from jQuery plugins for examples
		- Component libraries
			- Pros
				- You can build stuff pretty fast
			- Cons
				- Do a lot more than you need
			- Bootstrap

	- Live coding: build an example component

- When we stick to guide lines we set our selfs we become better in what we do
- We don't have to fight over decisions if there are already good decisions made for us
	- Decisions we influenced

- And so… you can become a great team as the A-Team.
